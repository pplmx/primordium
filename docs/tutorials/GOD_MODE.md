# God Mode: A Guide to User-Steered Evolution 🌌

## 1. Introduction: The Digital Deity 👁️

Welcome, Architect. In *Primordium*, you are not merely an observer of a digital screensaver; you are the **Digital Deity**. The simulation is a living, breathing garden, and you hold the shears, the seeds, and the lightning bolts.

While the engine is designed for autonomous emergence, your intervention can steer the course of history. Whether you wish to cultivate a peaceful utopia or forge a ruthless master race through artificial selection, the tools of creation are at your fingertips.

## 2. The Divine Toolkit 🛠️

### 2.1 Terrain Editing: Sculpting the World 🌍

The world is your canvas. Use the terrain brushes to reshape geography and control where life can flourish.

#### Terrain Brush Selection

| Key | Brush Type | Effect |
|-----|------------|--------|
| `1` | **Plains** | Default terrain, balanced resources |
| `2` | **Mountain** | Slow movement, impassable for prey |
| `3` | **River** | Fast movement corridor, blue food source |
| `4` | **Oasis** | High fertility, abundant green food |
| `5` | **Wall** | Impassable barrier, total isolation |
| `6` | **Barren** | Desert, minimal food, harsh conditions |

#### Mouse Controls for Terrain Editing

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Left Click** | Apply selected brush to single cell |
| **Hold & Drag** | Paint continuous strokes across terrain |
| **Right Click** | Inject food cluster at cursor position |

**Tips for Terrain Editing:**
- Create natural barriers (rivers, mountains) to isolate evolving populations
- Paint oasis rings around struggling populations to prevent extinction
- Use walls to create "evolutionary islands" for controlled breeding experiments
- Barren terrain acts as a filter—only the most adaptable survive

### 2.2 Social Climate Control 🎭

Beyond physical terrain, you can influence the social dynamics of regions.

| Key | Zone Type | Effect |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| `!` | **Peace Zone** | Aggression reduced to 0, no combat allowed |
| `@` | **War Zone** | Aggression doubled, combat bonuses active |
| `#` | **Neutral** | Reset to default social behavior |

Social zones override individual aggression settings, allowing you to create sanctuaries or bloodsports arenas.

### 2.3 Targeted Entity Intervention ⚡

Directly manipulate individual organisms to guide evolution or eliminate threats.

| Key | Action | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| `M` | **Mutate** | Apply random genetic modifications to selected entity |
| `K` | **Smite** | Remove selected entity from simulation |
| `P` | **Reincarnate** | Randomize selected entity's HexDNA completely |
| `F` | **Divine Relief**| Broadcast 500 energy to all kin of the selected entity across the network |
| `G` | **Resurrect** | Inject extinct genotype from fossil record |

#### Mutation Effects (`M`)
When you mutate an entity, the following traits may change:
- **Physical**: Sensing range, max speed, max energy capacity
- **Metabolic**: Metabolic niche (herbivore/carnivore balance)
- **Neural**: Brain topology (new neurons/connections), weight adjustments
- **Life History**: Reproductive investment, maturity rate

#### Reincarnation Effects (`P`)
Reincarnation completely randomizes the entity's HexDNA while preserving its identity. This is useful for:
- Introducing radically new traits into a stagnant lineage
- Creating "challenge runs" where ancient entities face modern conditions
- Testing genetic compatibility between distant lineages

## 3. Global Divine Powers 🌩️

### 3.1 Disaster Triggers

| Key | Disaster | Effect |
|-----|----------|--------|
| `Shift+K` | **Heat Wave** | Global temperature spikes, metabolism ×2.5 |
| `L` | **Mass Extinction** | 90% population wipe, ecosystem reset |
| `R` | **Resource Boom** | 100× food spawn rate for 500 ticks |
| `Shift+L` | **Dust Bowl** | Soil fertility drops, food stops growing |

#### Heat Wave
A divine heat wave raises global temperature dramatically:
- Metabolism increases by 2.5× across all entities
- Food spawn rate decreases by 50%
- Water tiles (rivers) become the only safe zones
- Lasts for 1000 ticks or until manually cancelled

#### Mass Extinction
The ultimate population control tool:
- 90% of all entities die instantly
- Lineage records preserved in fossil record
- Survivors gain mutation immunity for 200 ticks
- Ecosystem rebounds with explosive reproduction

#### Resource Boom
Divine abundance to prevent extinction events:
- Food spawn rate multiplied by 100×
- Lasts for 500 ticks
- Survivors gain energy bonus
- Can cause population explosion if not managed

### 3.2 Genetic Surge (`X`)

Trigger a **Genetic Surge** to force rapid evolution across the entire population:

- **All entities** receive random mutations
- **Mutation rate** increases 5× for 100 ticks
- **Neural plasticity** temporarily enhanced
- **New traits** have 30% higher chance of expression

Use Genetic Surge when:
- Population shows genetic stagnation
- Introducing new environmental pressures
- Breaking evolutionary plateaus

## 4. Walkthrough: Breeding a Master Race 🧬

Follow these steps to accelerate the evolution of a superior lineage:

1. **Isolate**: Use the **Wall brush (`5`)** to trap a promising population in a small, controlled area.
2. **Pressure**: Apply environmental stress. Use the **Barren brush (`6`)** to limit food, or create a **War Zone (`@`)** to introduce predation pressure. Only the strongest should survive.
3. **Mutate**: Press **`X`** to trigger a **Genetic Surge**, or select promising individuals and press **`M`** for targeted mutation. Watch for favorable mutations—higher speed, better sensing, or increased aggression.
4. **Select**: When a "Master" emerges, left-click to select it. Use **`C`** to export its HexDNA or **`W`** to save the world state.
5. **Refine**: Use **`P`** (Reincarnate) on underperformers to inject fresh genetic material, or **`K`** (Smite) to remove weak specimens.

## 5. Walkthrough: The Lazarus Project 💀

Death is not the end in *Primordium*. The **Fossil Record** remembers all.

1. **Enter Archeology Mode**: Press **`Y`** to open the historical browser.
2. **Find the Legend**: Use `[` and `]` to navigate through past snapshots. Look for extinct lineages that once dominated the world.
3. **Inspect**: Press **`Enter`** on a fossil entry to view its HexDNA and stats.
4. **Resurrect**: Press **`G`** to inject that DNA back into the current simulation. Watch as an ancient ghost walks the earth once more.

**Resurrection Tips:**
- Ancient organisms may struggle in modern conditions—consider creating a **Peace Zone (`!`)** sanctuary
- Cross-breeding ancient and modern lineages can produce hybrid vigor
- Legendary genotypes from the fossil record have unique traits worth preserving

## 6. Advanced: HexDNA Exchange 🔗

Every entity's soul is encoded in a **HexDNA string**—a compact representation of its physical traits and neural architecture.

| Action | Key | Description |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| **Export** | `C` | Copy selected entity's HexDNA to clipboard |
| **Import** | `V` | Import HexDNA from clipboard as new entity |

#### HexDNA Format
The HexDNA string encodes:
- **Physical Genes**: Sensing range, speed, energy capacity
- **Metabolic Genes**: Niche preference, carbon emission
- **Life History**: Reproductive investment, maturity rate
- **Neural Architecture**: Brain topology, connection weights

#### Sharing with Other Architects
1. Export your champion's HexDNA (`C`)
2. Share via chat, pastebin, or social media
3. Recipient imports with `V` to spawn the creature in their world

**Challenge**: Import an apex predator from another Architect's world. Will your master race survive the arrival of an alien hunter?

## 7. Time Travel: Archeology Mode ⏳

Access the historical record to understand evolution's long arc.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Y` | Toggle Archeology Mode |
| `[` / `]` | Navigate between snapshots |
| `Enter` | Inspect snapshot details |
| `G` | Resurrect selected fossil |

### Snapshot Information
Each snapshot captures:
- Population count and diversity metrics
- Top 5 dominant lineages
- Environmental conditions (temperature, fertility)
- Hall of Fame organisms

## 9. Best Practices for Deities 🎯

### Do's ✓
- **Experiment boldly**: The simulation is resilient—don't fear breaking it
- **Document discoveries**: Use `W` to save interesting evolutionary moments
- **Use isolation**: Walls and barriers create natural experiments
- **Balance intervention**: Too much guidance removes emergent beauty

### Don'ts ✗
- **Don't spam disasters**: Overuse desensitizes the population
- **Don't favor too heavily**: Let natural selection do most of the work
- **Don't ignore the fossil record**: Ancient lineages hold secrets

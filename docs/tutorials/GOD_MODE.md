# God Mode: A Guide to User-Steered Evolution 🌌

## 1. Introduction: The Digital Deity 👁️

Welcome, Architect. In *Primordium*, you are not merely an observer of a digital screensaver; you are the **Digital Deity**. The simulation is a living, breathing garden, and you hold the shears, the seeds, and the lightning bolts.

While the engine is designed for autonomous emergence, your intervention can steer the course of history. Whether you wish to cultivate a peaceful utopia or forge a ruthless master race through artificial selection, the tools of creation are at your fingertips.

## 2. The Toolkit 🛠️

### Environmental Control: Shaping the Crucible 🌍

The world is your canvas. Use the terrain and social brushes to define the boundaries of life.

* **Terrain Brushes (`$`, `%`, `^`)**:
    * `$` **Oasis**: Paint fertile ground to encourage population booms.
    * `%` **Wall**: Erect impassable barriers to isolate lineages or protect favorites.
    * `^` **Barren**: Create deserts to test the resilience of your subjects.
* **Social Brushes (`!`, `@`, `#`)**:
    * `!` **Peace Zone**: Enforce non-aggression. Ideal for breeding herbivores.
    * `@` **War Zone**: Heighten aggression and combat bonuses. The ultimate proving ground.
    * `#` **Neutral**: Reset the social climate of a region.

### Genetic Intervention: The Spark of Life ⚡

Directly manipulate the code of life to bypass the slow crawl of natural selection.

* **`X` Key: Genetic Surge**: Trigger a massive mutation event in the current population. Use this to break genetic stagnation and force new traits to emerge.
* **Right Click: Food Injection**: Manually place resources to guide migration patterns or save a starving favorite from the brink of extinction.

## 3. Walkthrough: Breeding a Master Race 🧬

Follow these steps to accelerate the evolution of a superior lineage:

1. **Isolate**: Use the **Wall brush (`%`)** to trap a promising population in a small, controlled area.
2. **Pressure**: Apply environmental stress. Use the **Barren brush (`^`)** to limit food, or introduce a predator. Only the strongest should survive.
3. **Mutate**: Press **`X`** to trigger a **Genetic Surge**. Watch for favorable mutations—higher speed, better sensing, or increased aggression.
4. **Cull**: If a mutation is unfavorable, let nature (or your brushes) take its course. If a "Master" emerges, use **`C`** to export their HexDNA or **`W`** to save the world state.

## 4. Walkthrough: The Lazarus Project 💀

Death is not the end in *Primordium*. The **Fossil Record** remembers all.

1. **Enter Archeology Mode**: Press **`Y`** to open the historical browser.
2. **Find the Legend**: Use `[` and `]` to navigate through past snapshots. Look for extinct lineages that once dominated the world.
3. **Resurrect**: Once you've found a legendary genotype, press **`G`** to inject that DNA back into the current simulation. Watch as an ancient ghost walks the earth once more.

## 5. Advanced: HexDNA Exchange 🔗

Every entity's soul is encoded in a **HexDNA string**—a compact representation of its physical traits and neural architecture.

* **Copying**: Select an entity and use the export function (see `MANUAL.md`) to get its HexDNA.
* **Sharing**: These strings can be shared with other Architects.
* **Pasting**: Use the migration tools to import a friend's species into your world. Will your master race survive the arrival of an alien apex predator?

**Go forth, Deity. The world awaits your command.** ⚡

# Welcome to Primordium

**Primordium (原初之境)** is a hardware-coupled artificial life simulation where digital organisms evolve neural networks in your terminal, with their world shaped by your computer's real-time performance.

> *Evolution in silicon, powered by your machine*

## What is Primordium?

Primordium is an experiment in **emergent complexity**. It transforms your host machine into a digital god where:

- **CPU Workload** becomes the environmental climate
- **RAM Pressure** controls resource scarcity
- **Neural Networks** emerge through natural selection
- **Every legendary organism's DNA** is preserved on blockchain
- **Your machine becomes a god**, and you become the observer

Every run is unique. Every lineage is precious. Every extinction teaches us something.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and run
git clone https://github.com/pplmx/primordium.git
cd primordium
cargo run --release

# Run in screensaver mode
cargo run --release -- --mode screensaver
```

## Key Features

- 🧠 **Neural Awakening**: Dynamic graph-based NEAT-lite brains evolve through natural selection
- 👥 **Social Life**: Tribes, hierarchies, castes, and interspecies cooperation
- 🦠 **Pathogens & Parasites**: Dynamic disease emergence and manipulation
- 🎹 **Procedural Audio**: FM synthesis and bio-music based on genetic codes
- 🌐 **P2P Multiverse**: Entities migrate between simulation instances
- 📜 **Blockchain Provenance**: Historical data anchored to Bitcoin via OpenTimestamps

## Documentation Structure

- **Architecture**: System design, module organization, and technical decisions
- **User Manual**: Controls, gameplay mechanics, and interaction guide
- **Wiki**: Deep dives into brain, genetics, ecosystem, and history systems
- **Changelog**: Version history and release notes
- **Roadmap**: Planned features and development priorities

## Running the Simulation

### Standard Mode
```bash
cargo run --release
```

### Screensaver Mode
```bash
cargo run --release -- --mode screensaver
```

### With Custom Configuration
```bash
cargo run --release -- --config path/to/config.toml
```

## Performance Scale

| Entity Count | Tick Time (avg) | Recommendations |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| 100-500 | <5ms | Any hardware setup |
| 500-1,000 | <15ms | Modern multi-core CPU preferred |
| 1,000-5,000 | <50ms | Requires 4+ cores, 32GB+ RAM suggested |
| 5,000-10,000+ | <100ms | Needs 8+ cores, 64GB+ RAM, SSD storage |

## Philosophy

Primordium is not just a screensaver—it's a **living laboratory**. Your specific hardware workload creates a one-of-a-kind evolutionary pressure. Every lineage is precious, and every extinction is a lesson in the primordial soup.
